        To select the word where your cursor is pointed, the most common and efficient methods use either the mouse or specific keyboard shortcuts. 
Using the Mouse
The standard method across most operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and applications is:
Double-click the word. This will select the entire word the cursor is currently inside or adjacent to. 
You can then click and drag to extend the selection to adjacent words or characters, if needed. 
Using the Keyboard
Keyboard shortcuts can vary slightly depending on your operating system and the specific application you are using (e.g., a word processor, code editor, or web browser).

Using the Keyboard
Keyboard shortcuts can vary slightly depending on your operating system and the specific application you are using (e.g., a word processor, code editor, or web browser). 
Windows & Linux
The most reliable sequence that works in many applications:
Press Ctrl + Left Arrow to jump to the beginning of the current or previous word.
Then, press Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow to select the word to the right (which is now the current word). 
Alternatively, some specific applications support a single shortcut: 
In some code editors like Sublime Text and Atom, Ctrl + D selects the word under the cursor.
In Microsoft Word, you can use the extended selection mode: press F8 twice. 
macOS
The standard method involves the Option (⌥) or Command (⌘) keys: 
Double-click the word with the mouse.
There isn't a single universal built-in keyboard shortcut across all apps, but many native applications support the sequence:
Option + Left Arrow to move to the beginning of the word.
Then, Option + Shift + Right Arrow to select it. 
Some applications allow for customization, or use a specific shortcut like Control + W to select the current word (e.g., in some terminals or code editors after configuration). 
You can then click and drag to extend the selection to adjacent words or characters, if needed.
